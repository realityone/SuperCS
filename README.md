# SuperCS

The final way to help humans free their left hand.

> Still in developing.

## Overview

My friend **@OuO**'s left hand always cramps when he wants to copy or save a piece of text or a file, he told me is there a way to save his left hand ~~otherwise he will lose his keyboard~~.

This project will help people like **@OuO** to free their left hand.

## Principle

Hook the `Command+C` and `Command+S` event, repeat 50 times.(I guess repeat 50 times is enough to ensure this event has been triggered.`(*-Ï‰-*)`)
